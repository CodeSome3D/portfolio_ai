# AI Generative Art & Imagery Portfolio

Live site: https://codesome3d.github.io/portfolio_ai/

A modern, high-aesthetic portfolio web application for AI artists, concept designers, and creative technologists. It runs on the same system as the 3D portfolio (https://codesome3d.github.io/3d-viz-prtf/). Designed to run directly on **GitHub Pages** (or any static web host) with zero build steps or npm installations.

## ✨ Features

- **Custom Metadata Per Image**:
  - **AI Models** (multi-select supported!): *Midjourney*, *ChatGPT*, *NanoBanana*, *ComfyUI*, *Claude*, *MiniMax*, *LTX* (color-coded badges).
  - **Category**: *3D Miniatures*, *Product & Tech*, *Characters & Fashion*, *Environments & Sci-Fi*, *Creatures & Art*.
  - **Year** (optional) **& Description**.
- **YouTube Videos as Artworks**: paste a YouTube link in the editor and the work shows up with a play button and an embedded player in the lightbox.
- **Clean Thumbnails**: Metadata badges appear cleanly underneath each thumbnail (no floating toast overlays obstructing your artwork).
- **GitHub Pages Ready**: Zero build dependencies, pure HTML5, modern Vanilla CSS, and modular JavaScript. Uses relative paths so it functions immediately on `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.
- **Owner Mode & Privacy**:
  - You can open Owner Mode anytime by pressing **`Ctrl + Alt + E`** (or visiting with `?edit=1`), or clicking the discrete **"🔒 Owner Access"** button in the footer.
  - Upon unlocking, the **"Edit Gallery"** button appears prominently in the navigation bar and controls toolbar, giving 1-click access to add artworks and reorder the gallery.
  - Since GitHub Pages is static, changes made in a browser cannot alter your GitHub repository directly. You can update values in the browser, download `works.js`, or commit directly with a GitHub token.
- **Interactive Lightbox Modal**: Native HTML `<dialog>` with backdrop blur, full-resolution display, dynamic image resolution calculation, zoom & pan controls, and keyboard navigation (Left/Right arrows, Escape).
- **Instant Filtering & Search**:
  - Filter chips by Category and AI Model.
  - Live full-text search across artwork names, AI models, categories, and descriptions.
  - Sort by default, name (A-Z / Z-A), and newest year.
  - Layout toggle between dynamic **Masonry** flow and structured **Grid**.

## 📝 How to Save & Publish Your Metadata Changes

Because GitHub Pages is a static host without a backend database:

### 1. Instant Browser Persistence (`localStorage`)
- Any change you make in the on-page editor and click **"Save Changes"** is **automatically saved to your browser** (`localStorage`).
- **Refreshing the page or reopening the browser will NOT lose your edits.**

### 2. Making Changes Live on GitHub Pages (for everyone):
Choose either option:

#### Option A: One-Click Direct GitHub Sync (Recommended)
1. In the **Metadata Inspector** modal, expand **"Direct GitHub Sync"**.
2. Enter your repository (`username/portfolio_ai`) and a GitHub Personal Access Token (with `repo` write permission).
3. Click **"Commit & Push to GitHub"**.
4. The site commits `data/works.js` directly to your GitHub repository! GitHub Pages will build and update automatically in ~60 seconds.

#### Option B: Download & Git Push
1. In the on-page editor, click **"Download works.js"** (or **"Copy Code"**).
2. Replace `data/works.js` with your downloaded file.
3. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add data/works.js
   git commit -m "Update portfolio metadata"
   git push
   ```

```javascript
{
  "id": "001",
  "name": "3D Print Miniature - Cyber Paladin",
  "file": "images/miniature_cyber-paladin_01.png",
  "model": ["Midjourney"],        // one or more of: Midjourney, ChatGPT, NanoBanana, ComfyUI, Claude, MiniMax, LTX
  "category": "3D Miniatures",
  "year": "",                     // optional
  "description": "..."
}
```

Simply change the strings to whatever you like.

## 🖼️ Adding & Reordering Images Freely

### 1. Flexible Filenames (No Numbering Required!)
You **do NOT need to number your image filenames** (e.g. `001_`, `002_`). You can name your files whatever you like:
- `images/miniature_cyber-paladin_01.png`
- `images/art_captain-lizzard_01.jpg`

The current files follow the same `<category>_<project>_<NN>` scheme as the 3D portfolio (prefixes: `miniature`, `product`, `fashion`, `environment`, `art`).

The order images appear in the gallery is determined **solely by their position in the array** in `data/works.js`, which can be reordered at any time!

### 2. In-Browser Visual Reordering (Owner Mode)
1. Unlock Owner Mode (`Ctrl + Alt + E` or click **"🔒 Owner Access"** in the footer) and click **"Edit Gallery"** in the header or toolbar.
2. In the Gallery Organizer, you can:
   - **Drag & Drop** any image card into any position.
   - Click **▲ Up**, **▼ Down**, **⤒ Top**, or **⤓ Bottom**.
   - Type an exact position number (e.g. type `3` to jump directly to 3rd place).
4. Changes update the live gallery immediately and save to your browser!
5. Click **"Download works.js"** or **"Commit & Push to GitHub"** to publish the new order live to GitHub Pages.

### 3. Adding an Image at Any Position
1. Save your image into the `images/` folder.
2. In the browser editor, click **"+ Add New Artwork"**.
3. Under **"Placement in Gallery"**, choose:
   - **At the beginning (1st item)**
   - **At specific position...** (e.g. Position #3)
   - **At the end (last item)**
4. Click **"Add to Portfolio Gallery"**! All IDs are automatically normalized sequentially.

## ▶️ Adding YouTube Videos

Any artwork can be a YouTube video instead of a still image.

**In the browser editor (Owner Mode):** open **+ Add Artwork**, set **Artwork Type** to *YouTube video* and paste the link (`https://youtu.be/...`, `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...` and Shorts links all work). A poster image from `images/` is optional; without one, YouTube's own thumbnail is used. An existing artwork can be turned into a video (or back) with the **YouTube Link** field in **Edit Artwork Details**. **Delete** removes an artwork from the gallery.

**By hand in `data/works.js`:** add a `youtube` field. `file` becomes optional and is used as the poster:

```javascript
{
  "id": "031",
  "name": "My Animation",
  "youtube": "https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID",
  "file": "images/my-animation-poster.jpg",   // optional
  "category": "...",
  "year": "2026",
  "description": "..."
}
```

Video cards show a play button and the lightbox plays the video in an embedded player (youtube-nocookie.com). Tip: test locally through a small web server (`python -m http.server`), because YouTube embeds can refuse to play when `index.html` is opened directly from disk.

## 🗂️ Projects (multi-image cards)

A Project is one gallery card that holds 2 or more images and/or YouTube videos. The card shows the first item as its preview, carries a **Project · N** badge and a stacked-card look, and the **Projects** chip in the category filter shows only projects. Clicking the card opens the project's own sub-gallery (with the project name, info and description on top); the lightbox then steps through the project's materials. **All works**, the browser Back button or Esc returns to the main gallery. Each project has its own link: `#project=<slug>`.

**In the browser editor (Owner Mode):** in **+ Add Artwork** set **Artwork Type** to *Project* and list the materials one per line (an `images/...` path or a YouTube link, optionally followed by ` | title`). In **Edit Artwork Details**, the **Project Materials** field turns any artwork into a project as soon as it has 2 or more lines, and back into a single work when only 1 line is left. To build a project from artworks that are already in the gallery, open **Reorder Gallery**, tick 2 or more of them and click **Merge into Project**: the top-most one becomes the cover and keeps its place, category and tools, the others are removed from the main grid and become items of the project, each keeping its own title, description and year. Merging a project with other works adds them to it. Note: export or push after creating a project, and export any unsaved browser edits before converting a work.

**By hand in `data/works.js`:**

```javascript
{
  "id": "032",
  "name": "My Project",
  "project": "my-project",                       // url slug, unique
  "items": [
    { "file": "images/category_my-project_01.jpg" },   // first item = cover
    { "file": "images/category_my-project_02.jpg", "name": "Detail" },
    { "youtube": "https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID", "name": "Turntable" }
  ],
  "category": "...",
  "description": "..."
}
```

All other fields (category, tools, year, description) belong to the project and apply to every item. An item can override its own title, description, year, category and AI model (same field names as a work); in the editor pick it in the **Editing** list of a project (or click **Edit This Artwork** on it in the lightbox). The SEO build makes thumbnails for every item and lists them all in the sitemap.

---

## 🔎 SEO Build

Run this after you add, remove, rename or reorder artworks in `data/works.js` (needs Python and Pillow: `pip install pillow`):

```bash
python tools/seo_build.py
```

It regenerates the small WebP gallery thumbnails in `thumbs/`, `sitemap.xml` (images and videos) and the static gallery cards + structured data inside `index.html`. Videos are listed as `VideoObject`s. Google only shows video rich results when a video has an upload date, so you can optionally add `"uploadDate": "2026-10-22"` to a video entry by hand.
